<h2><a name="HoLR">House of Lords reform - projected results</a></h2>
<p align='justify'>These projections are based on the plans laid out in the '<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0052/13052.pdf">House of Lords Reform Bill 2012</a>.' This bill was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-19149212">not passed through parliament</a>, but would have gradually introduced proportionally elected members alongside appointed ones. By 2020, the upper chamber would have comprised of 240 directly elected members, 60 members appointed by an independent advisory body, and 16 Lords Spiritual (Bishops).</p>

<p align='justify'>The proportionally elected seats follow on from those used in former elections to the European parliament and those used for statistical purposes currently in the UK. The UK is divided into 12 countries or regions (pictured below, <a href="https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/area_defns_eu.html">image credit</a>). Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland constitue their own district, while England is divided into nine regions: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, West Midlands, East Midlands, Anglia/Eastern, South West, London, and South East. Seats are apportioned to each electoral district based on the size of each respective electorate - the smallest constituency is Northern Ireland with 7 seats, and South East England with 33 seats of the 240 total. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="area_map_small.jpg"></p>

<p align='justify'>The results below project the 316-seat reformed House of Lords based on elections and polls since 2009 (the most recent EU/General elections from the introduction of the draft Reform Bill). In reality, members - and therefore the shape of the house - would not change so frequently so each result shows a snapshot of the political opinion at a given election expressed proportionally.</p>

<p align='justify'>The intended voted system according to the Reform Bill is a "party list" system, and the Single Transferable Vote (STV) in Northern Ireland. It is therefore reasonable to state that the D'Hondt system is a realistic method to simulate proportional electoral results, and is therefore used here in all electoral districts. The statistics for historical general elections and constituencies was gathered from <a href="https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/flatfile.html">Electoral Calculus data</a>, raw data for European Union elections, and the Electoral Calculus <a href="https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/userregpoll.html">poll of polls</a> for poll data. Northern Ireland is modelled with D'Hondt, as these statistics do not provide order of preference statistics.</p>

<h2><a name="HoCr">House of Commons - proportionally elected based on UK countries and regions</a></h2>

<p align='justify'>As House of Lords reform seems like a distant prospect, and not overwhelmingly popular with the public, what if the House of Commons was elected proportionally?</p>

<p align='justify'>In this section, the same 12 electoral districts (made up of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the nine English Regions) are used and seats are split proportionally among them. <a href="https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/flatfile.html">Historical data</a> from all UK General Elections since 1955 are used to model each election. The total number of seats reflects the real size of the House of Commons for all of these elections, and ranges from 630-659 members. However, the size of each electoral district's electorate is then used to allocate seats to each district. For example, the smallest district for the 2019 General Election is Northern Ireland with 18 seats (the same as at Westminster currently), and the largest is South East England with 91 seats (currently 84 at Westminster).</p>

<h2><a name="HoCc">House of Commons - proportionally elected based on UK counties</a></h2>
<p align='justify'>A common criticism of proportional system is that they do not allow local representation. This simulation, which instead takes smaller 'Counties' instead of regions allows multi-member consituencies for each provided county in the dataset which is similar to the current electoral system in Spain.</p>
